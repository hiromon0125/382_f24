Remote sensing kind of gives itself away in what exactly it is. Typically, I will spend the week before a class pouring over content and looking for resources that will be of interest to me, to you, and to some folks in my working group. I then take the common language and concepts among those disparate spaces and organize it into a loose exploration of those concepts. 

Today, you are all my sensors. 

Please organize yourselves so you can answer these questions. For each question, please post an answer and include a URL of where that answer came from. However, please do not post the full URL as it is ugly and distracting. Please make them hyperlinks.

1. **What is remote sensing?**

7. **What kind of data does remote sensing include?**

8. **In what circumstances are feet a remote sensor? In an earthquake, when the floor is wet, detecting temperature changes, finding where the floor is(uneven surface)**

9. **If I were to design a remote sensor for some phenomenon, what would that thing be tasked at sensing?**

10. **Why is it needed?**

11. **So** **I** **have** **asked** **a** **class** **of** **30** **individuals** **(of** **which** **around** **10** **will** **have** **actively contributed** **to** **this** **task)** **for** **solid** **answers** **about** **what** **remote** **sensing** **is.** **What weaknesses could there be in the data feed from my remote sensors?**
