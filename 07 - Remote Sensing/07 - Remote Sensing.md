Remote sensing kind of gives itself away in what exactly it is. Typically, I will spend the week before a class pouring over content and looking for resources that will be of interest to me, to you, and to some folks in my working group. I then take the common language and concepts among those disparate spaces and organize it into a loose exploration of those concepts. 

Today, you are all my sensors. 

Please organize yourselves so you can answer these questions. For each question, please post an answer and include a URL of where that answer came from. However, please do not post the full URL as it is ugly and distracting. Please make them hyperlinks.

5. What is Passive remote sensing? Please provide 3 definitions from different sources. Those sources will form the basis of your answer to the next question.
	* Passive remote sensing is basically the study of the interaction between light sources and Earth’s surface features, in which every feature has a unique spectral response. - [Passive Remote Sensing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/passive-remote-sensing#:~:text=Passive%20remote%20sensing%20is%20basically,has%20an%20unique%20spectral%20response.)
	* In passive remote sensing, the sensor measures radiation reflected or emitted from the surface. The main source of radiation reaching the Earth is the Sun. -[Science Direct](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/remote-sensing)
	* A passive sensor is a microwave instrument designed to receive and measure natural emissions produced by constituents of the Earth’s surface and its atmosphere. -[Active vs Passive Remote Sensing](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/somd/space-communications-navigation-program/remote-sensing/)

7. What kind of data does remote sensing include?
	* [National Geodetic Survey](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/remote-sensing.shtml) 
	* Remote sensing of the earth from satellites relies primarily on data around electromagnetic waves that the earth produces or reflects [(USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used). This includes visible light, but could also include other wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum like ultraviolet and infrared light. The satellite’s location and the current time are collected alongside this data. On the surface of the earth, remote sensing includes sonar(sound/pressure data), alongside other more esoteric data like gravity measurements.
8. In what circumstances are feet a remote sensor?
	* They can be used for situations involving vibrations, temperature, or pain. They can detect these three points of sensory data through Mechanoreceptors, Thermo receptors, and Nociceptors. - [Feet as a remote sensor](https://www.medboundtimes.com/fitness-and-wellness/perceiving-the-world-through-your-feet)
9. If I were to design a remote sensor for some phenomenon, what would that thing be tasked at sensing?
	* Remote sensors often can measure wavelengths of light or sound that are reflected off of the subject or area being observed. This device should have an emitter and a receptor. Lidar, lasers, and sonar are prime examples of how we use waves to measure distance from a point. Using distances, we can accurately make a textured surface that models the area or subject that was observed.
	* In the case of an evacuation, we could design a remote sensor to measure the amount of sound coming from stairways to determine the most available path out of a particular building.
	* Remote sensing can also be used for tracking phenomena such as forest fires, urbanization, and weather patterns. - [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used). 
10. Why is it needed?
	* Remote sensing is needed because it allows us to observe large plots of land from space or even the bottom of the ocean without having to send something down hundreds of feet. Remote sensing provides many benefits to us such as being able to read temperatures around the oceans and being able to map/seethe size of raging wildfires and where they are moving. We can also use it to track weather patterns allowing us to know when it will rain, or even look at the growth of cities and see how that affects the surrounding forests and farmlands. Being able to “see” the bottom of our oceans allows us to better understand how the seismic activity of the planet works and how the continents move. So, there are many ways that remote sensing is useful and that it is needed for the development of our societies.
11. So I have asked a class of 30 individuals (of which around 10 will have actively contributed to this task) for solid answers about what remote sensing is. What weaknesses could there be in the data feed from my remote sensors?
	* There could be an incomplete or varied understanding of the data on the subject.
		* Face value information is being used for the answers instead of thorough research
	* Most people will not be fact-checking the information so it only takes one or two people to screw up the information gathered by everybody else
	* The data being gathered is not representative of the whole population or the understanding of the whole class – it will only be representative of the contributors to the assignment
	* The contributors can actively edit each other’s work, which could present an analog to “interference”- one person editing another’s work could muddle the original meaning (but could also enhance it)
