# <a id="testpreview"></a>What you'll be tested on (All of the content the whole semester)

# <a id = "01"></a>Week 01 - Foundation
* **Space** - What is the definition? An area cleared for cultivation. 
* **Cultivate** - What is cultivation?
* **Cassini** - A family of scientists or astronomers who revolutionized maps and mapping. 
* **Composite of France** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_map. This map is the first map to be based on a [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic "Geodesic") triangulation.
* **Kriegspiel** - A game made to counter Napoleon's use of triangulation and maps.
* **Sand Table** - Originally in ancient greece, Sand Tables were used for counting. Eventually, they would become a rudimentary board for board games, war games, military training, and are currently used in augmented reality.
* **Triangulation** - determining the location of where a point is given the angles toward it from a known point.
* **Information Age** - During the battle of Jena Auerstadt, Hegel, watching the battle, declared Napoleon to be the embodiment of a the spirit of an age. Later, Foucault would call this the age of empiricism and later, it would be called the age of information.
* **Geospatial** - from [here](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/geospatial#:~:text=%3A%20consisting%20of%2C%20derived%20from%2C,spatial%20(or%20geospatial)%20mining.): consisting of, derived from, or relating to data that is directly linked to specific geographical locations. If the data set consists of geographical information, it is called spatial (or geospatial) mining.

# <a id = "02"></a>Week 02 - How do Maps Work?
- **Bar Scale** - representative distance in reference to scale of a map (e.g. 1" = 1mil).
- **compass** - [https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/compass](https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/compass)
- **Conformal Map** - a type of map where angles, scales, and shapes on a map are preserved rather than adapted for the projection.
- **direction** - [https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/direction](https://support.esri.com/en-us/gis-dictionary/direction)

# <a id = "04"></a>Week 04 - Game Maps
- **Game Cartography Interface** - An interface that affords users the ability to manipulate geographic data.
- **Playful Mapping** - Taking concepts from games and using them in similar ways with actual geographic information.
- **Maps of Fictional Places** - All maps are essentially maps of fictional places as in reality we need to be there to carry forward the idea of reality. That said, a map is often one artifact that is essential for making a place feel more real.
- **Avalon Hill** - This is a company that was essential for the development of both Dungeons and Dragons but also maps for tabletop games and really just popular culture mapping.
- **Outdoor Survival** - This is a game that isn't really a game. Instead, it was a best seller because the first edition of Dungeons and Dragons recommended its purchase for the map it contained.
- **Dungeons and Dragons** - This is a game that matches imaginary play developed across the decades of war and the World Wars with individual, officer rules for games that began being developed after the battles of Jena and Auerstadt. Strategos, developed by an American, is the US version of another game called Kriegspiel.
- **Play on Map** - When we began working on games and developing video games, the most logical thing was to work on the map that was included in the box with games.
- **Draw Map on Paper** - Eventually, we began to hide the map and play involved drawing it while exploration was happening.
- **3D and Maps** - As games developed a z-axis, we began to be able to create terrain that was 3dimensional. To deal with this, we began to import developments of maps from the outside.

# <a id = "06"></a>Week 06 - Intro to Geospatial Analysis
- **Geospatial Analysis** - a form of computational analysis that uses geographic information, spatial data, location data, and increasingly, high-resolution imagery, computer vision, and other forms of AI to extract structured data that can be used for specific applications and industries. [From here](https://capeanalytics.com/blog/geospatial-analytics-what-is-it-how-can-it-give-you-a-competitive-edge/#:~:text=Geospatial%20analytics%20is%20a%20form,for%20specific%20applications%20and%20industries.)

The basis of GIS from ESRI is Google Maps + Excel at its most basic. However, what this comparison provides is incomplete. To make it more complete, we can say that GIS is _actually_ Google Maps + Excel + the Python Interpreter.

You may wonder how and why Python is involved here and we won't specifically get into this in this course. Instead, we will discuss analyses that have been performed using the full breadth and depth of GIS and talk a little bit about how and what went into those analyses.

For the most part, I have tried to grab a higher level analysis that has data that is available and with the help of a whole lot of tutorials, you could begin an analysis. First and foremost, at least for my time as a sort-of geospatial analyst, we tend to use the data from the United States Census.

Collecting data is enormously expensive and any decisions to study something has to begin with finding or collecting it in some capacity. Here are a few fun repositories:

- [https://data.census.gov/](https://data.census.gov/)
- [https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?metadata_type=geospatial](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?metadata_type=geospatial)
- [https://data.world/datasets/geospatial](https://data.world/datasets/geospatial)
- [https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/](https://freegisdata.rtwilson.com/)

From examining travel patterns in a municipality to trying to figure out where a new Starbucks or Target could go, there is an enormous amount of information out there that folks can crunch to figure this stuff out. We'll briefly go over a few of those things.
### Travel Studies
Every decade or so, municipalities reform their strategic plan. For example, here's Rochester's: [https://www.cityofrochester.gov/rochester2034/](https://www.cityofrochester.gov/rochester2034/)

They then contact a statistics and data gathering firm to perform a study of how people travel in the area. From here, they use the data to identify traffic patterns, where new roads or new subdivisions or strip malls or commercial zones could be located. They'll also look for areas of crime, areas of congestion, and look for ways to deal with them. You can read about a few of these projects here:

- [https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/secure-transportation-data/tsdc-atlanta-regional-travel-survey.html](https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/secure-transportation-data/tsdc-atlanta-regional-travel-survey.html)
- [https://libguides.northwestern.edu/c.php?g=114808&p=748275](https://libguides.northwestern.edu/c.php?g=114808&p=748275)
### Retailers
Retailers will use GIS for 2 distinct reasons: where to locate a store and where to locate items in a store. There is a TON of work on this from a variety of different spaces.
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol0SvsF2kP0&ab_channel=CARTO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol0SvsF2kP0&ab_channel=CARTO)
### Segregation
Most of our work on desegregating and correcting the history of our founding has been policy driven. While policy tends to try and force equity, there's still an absolutely huge amount of work to do. Geospatial analysis can provide us with a literal microscope to evaluate where that work is successful and not. Check out the following:

### Disaster Planning and Mitigation
One of the oversights of humans in general is that we build things with little to no consideration of the world. The world then reminds us that things like water, fire, and earth can create massive problems for anyone nearby. To that end, we've really begun to work in and around the concept of "mitigation" or staging a bunch of resources and preparing for the inevitable events that will impact wherever we are.

# <a id = "07"></a>Week 07 - Remote Sensing
Remote sensing kind of gives itself away in what exactly it is. Typically, I will spend the week before a class pouring over content and looking for resources that will be of interest to me, to you, and to some folks in my working group. I then take the common language and concepts among those disparate spaces and organize it into a loose exploration of those concepts. 

Today, you are all my sensors. 

Please organize yourselves so you can answer these questions. For each question, please post an answer and include a URL of where that answer came from. However, please do not post the full URL as it is ugly and distracting. Please make them hyperlinks.

1. **What is remote sensing?** Please provide 3 definitions from different sources. Those sources will form the basis of your answer to the next question.
	* “Remote sensing is the process of detecting and monitoring the physicalcharacteristics of an area by measuring its reflected and emitted radiation at adistance.” [U.S Geological Survey]((https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used))
	* b. “Remote sensors collect data by detecting natural energy that is reflected fromEarth’s surface. These sensors can be on satellites or mounted on aircraft,passive or active.” [What is remote sensing](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/remotesensing.html)?
	* c. “Remote sensing is the practice of obtaining information about the Earth’s surface by analyzing data collected from special instruments that are not physically in contact with the objects being studied.” Remote Sensing - an Overview

7. **What kind of data does remote sensing include?**
	* [National Geodetic Survey](https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/INFO/remote-sensing.shtml) 
	* Remote sensing of the earth from satellites relies primarily on data around electromagnetic waves that the earth produces or reflects [(USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used). This includes visible light, but could also include other wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum like ultraviolet and infrared light. The satellite’s location and the current time are collected alongside this data. On the surface of the earth, remote sensing includes sonar(sound/pressure data), alongside other more esoteric data like gravity measurements.
8. **In what circumstances are feet a remote sensor?**
	* They can be used for situations involving vibrations, temperature, or pain. They can detect these three points of sensory data through Mechanoreceptors, Thermo receptors, and Nociceptors. - [Feet as a remote sensor](https://www.medboundtimes.com/fitness-and-wellness/perceiving-the-world-through-your-feet)
9. If I were to design a remote sensor for some phenomenon, what would that thing be tasked at sensing?
	* Remote sensors often can measure wavelengths of light or sound that are reflected off of the subject or area being observed. This device should have an emitter and a receptor. Lidar, lasers, and sonar are prime examples of how we use waves to measure distance from a point. Using distances, we can accurately make a textured surface that models the area or subject that was observed.
	* In the case of an evacuation, we could design a remote sensor to measure the amount of sound coming from stairways to determine the most available path out of a particular building.
	* Remote sensing can also be used for tracking phenomena such as forest fires, urbanization, and weather patterns. - [USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-remote-sensing-and-what-it-used). 
10. Why is it needed?
	* Remote sensing is needed because it allows us to observe large plots of land from space or even the bottom of the ocean without having to send something down hundreds of feet. Remote sensing provides many benefits to us such as being able to read temperatures around the oceans and being able to map/seethe size of raging wildfires and where they are moving. We can also use it to track weather patterns allowing us to know when it will rain, or even look at the growth of cities and see how that affects the surrounding forests and farmlands. Being able to “see” the bottom of our oceans allows us to better understand how the seismic activity of the planet works and how the continents move. So, there are many ways that remote sensing is useful and that it is needed for the development of our societies.
11. So I have asked a class of 30 individuals (of which around 10 will have actively contributed to this task) for solid answers about what remote sensing is. What weaknesses could there be in the data feed from my remote sensors?
	* There could be an incomplete or varied understanding of the data on the subject.
		* Face value information is being used for the answers instead of thorough research
	* Most people will not be fact-checking the information so it only takes one or two people to screw up the information gathered by everybody else
	* The data being gathered is not representative of the whole population or the understanding of the whole class – it will only be representative of the contributors to the assignment
	* The contributors can actively edit each other’s work, which could present an analog to “interference”- one person editing another’s work could muddle the original meaning (but could also enhance it)

1. We refer to the event that creates the disaster a hazard. These hazards can be natural, manmade, and technological.
2. Disasters begin long before the hazard and as such, we can map those risky areas if we wanted to.
3. Vulnerability and risk are not equal across the population. 

But what does this have to do with maps? 

1. 3 Kinds of Maps

We can say that there are 3 kinds of maps we have for disaster. Those maps are: 

1. A Map of the Local Area.
City planning is a process that does not check in with emergency management. The reason this matters is that most of your vulnerabilities and weaknesses originate here.

Why?

2. A Map of Risk and Vulnerability.

What is risk?

Does this matter?

Let's talk about the following image:

What does this mean?

But don't take my word for it.

4. A Map of Disaster Damage in Situ.

# <a id = "10"></a>Week 10 - Map Design
For this week, I asked you to draw a map from my office to class. I then asked you to draw that same map in GIS. What we found was that: 
1. Scale was hard to keep track of via paper because we are used to computers keeping that scale for us. 
2. The next part was that many of us relied on existing floorplans. This meant that almost all of the drawing was done and so we were transcribing. If those floorplans didn't exist, we would have to create our scale from scratch.
3. In a perfect world, we'd be taking 2 floorplans with the same scale and then applying that scale to external spaces but that is difficult as there are no scales on the floorplans that exist.
4. GIS can only provide top-down, external-based floorplans. While GIS can do 3D maps, the concept does not really change. It is still external to external. This does not change the criticism of GIS only being able to map from outside door to outside door because it's simply a 3D box rather than a 2D box. There is still no map inside.
# <a id = "11"></a>Week 11 - Future of Maps
We talked about the potential futures that exist for our world. Most of what we talked about is included in our homework assignment. 

As such, we turn to the concept of design fiction. We'll use [this definition](https://https://augerloizeau.tumblr.com/post/53524176947/definition-of-speculative-design): 

_Speculative design combines informed, hypothetical extrapolations of an emerging technology’s development with a deep consideration of the cultural landscape into which it might be deployed, to speculate on future products, systems and services. These speculations are then used to examine and encourage dialogue on the impact a specific technology may have on our everyday lives. The familiar and engaging nature of the designed output is intended to facilitate discourse with a broad audience: from experts in the field such as scientists, engineers and designers to the consumers and users of technological products and systems._ 

The tests for this section will hinge (after the definition), on speculating for a few of these.

1. AI and Geospatial Technologies
    - What is an application of AI that could be useful?
2. Indoor-based location Services
    - Once we go inside a space, maps no longer work. What would it take to get them to work and what would the consequence be?
3. Disaster and Mapping
    - Disaster requires rapid mapping with piecemeal information and little infrastructure. How do you fix that?
4. Land Development, AI, and Mapping
    - When we develop an area for building, or just human settlement in general, there are unintended consequences. Can AI help here?
5. Predicting Climate Change Consequence 
    - This is a difficult space as large swathes of the population do not believe in climate change while everyone else deals with it. What can we do?


# <a id = "12"></a>Week 12 - Ethics
* **redistricting** - This is a form of unethical map design wherein a political party redraws representative districts based on the likelihood that regardless of how much voting occurs, one party will remain on top.
- **gdpr** - Your data, including where you live, and where you have lived, are protected under this european plan for data security. This legislation is the result of interference in a variety of elections (2016 presidential in the us, Brexit, and parliamentary elections in the UK)
- **surveying** - When land parcels are examined, it is possible for the surveying team to push land boundaries around. This can result in property becoming larger or smaller suddenly and can have an impact on property values. 
- **redlining** - based on popular pseudoscience of the era — was that the presence of any population of Black residents was a sign of impending property value decline. Pretty soon, Mr. Lasner says, private lenders started using the government’s map lines as well — effectively barring Black home buyers from qualifying for secure mortgages from many mainstream banks. Later this would take the form of being unable to secure utilities if you could get loans.
- **indoor** - Maps work from external door to external door. Sometimes it's just to the exterior of a building or a general location in a parking lot where you're meant to find yourself the rest of the way. We talked about in class how this could result in potential uses about indoor based locations for terrorist attacks, school shootings, and other forms of malintent. the benefits and weaknesses of this concept are still being discussed and will be for quite some time.
