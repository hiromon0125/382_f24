# <a id="midterm"></a>Concepts to Date
For this week, I asked you to draw a map from my office to class. I then asked you to draw that same map in GIS. What we found was that: 
1. Scale was hard to keep track of via paper because we are used to computers keeping that scale for us. 
2. The next part was that many of us relied on existing floorplans. This meant that almost all of the drawing was done and so we were transcribing. If those floorplans didn't exist, we would have to create our scale from scratch.
3. In a perfect world, we'd be taking 2 floorplans with the same scale and then applying that scale to external spaces but that is difficult as there are no scales on the floorplans that exist.
4. GIS can only provide top-down, external-based floorplans. While GIS can do 3D maps, the concept does not really change. It is still external to external. This does not change the criticism of GIS only being able to map from outside door to outside door because it's simply a 3D box rather than a 2D box. There is still no map inside.
